    "## Intended Audience\n",
    "While ArviZ strives to provide an easy way for Bayesian practioners to create exploratory plots and statistics, the package and docs alone do not explain how to **use** the exploratory plots and statistics. This repository is aimed to fill that gap, and serve as more in depth explanaton to all the functionality in ArviZ. Ideally it will be a handy reference for Bayesian practitioners that are using probabilistic programming but may be unfamiliar with the various methods of model criticism.\n",

    "For those interested in how to construct models either  PyMC3 or Pystan, both libraries documentation numerous example.\n",
